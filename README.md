# DSA_Scratch_Implementation
Prerequisites and Implementations from Scratch of DSA Questions.
1. Arrays & Strings  
   - Implement a dynamic array (like ArrayList in Java or list in Python).  
   - Implement a hash map (with collision handling via chaining or open addressing).  
   - Write a function to reverse a string in-place.  
   - Write a function to check if a string is a palindrome.
2. Binary Search & Sorting 
   - Implement binary search (iterative and recursive).
   - Implement one O(n log n) sorting algorithm (e.g., merge sort or quick sort).
3. Two Pointers & Sliding Window
   - Implement a sliding window to find a subarray with a given sum.
   - Implement two-pointer technique to remove duplicates from a sorted array.
4. Stacks & Queues
   - Implement a stack using an array and a linked list.
   - Implement a queue using an array (circular queue) and a linked list.
   - Implement a queue using two stacks.
5. Linked Lists
   - Implement a singly linked list with insert, delete, and reverse operations.
   - Detect a cycle in a linked list using Floyd’s cycle detection algorithm.
   - Merge two sorted linked lists.
6. Trees (Binary Trees & BSTs)  
   - Implement a binary tree node and basic traversals (recursive and iterative).
   - Implement a BST with insert, delete, and search operations.
   - Validate if a binary tree is a BST.
7. Graphs 
   - Implement BFS and DFS for a graph represented as an adjacency list.
   - Implement union-find with path compression and union by rank.
   - Detect a cycle in an undirected graph using DFS and union-find.
8. Heaps & Priority Queues  
   - Implement heap sort.
   - Implement a min-heap (or max-heap) using an array.
9. Greedy 
   - Implement a greedy algorithm for interval scheduling (like the activity selection problem).
   - Implement a greedy algorithm for coin change (when applicable).
10. Dynamic Programming
   - Implement the Fibonacci sequence using memoization and tabulation.
   - Implement the 0/1 knapsack problem using DP.
   - Implement longest common subsequence (LCS) using DP.
11. Backtracking
   - Implement a backtracking solution for generating all permutations of a string.
   - Solve the N-Queens problem using backtracking.
12. System Design
   - Implement an LRU cache using a hash map and doubly linked list.
   - Implement a Trie (prefix tree) for word insertion and search.
   - Design a circular queue using an array.
